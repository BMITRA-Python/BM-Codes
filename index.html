            <!-- Bootstrap works using a 12 columns concept. 
What you are creating here is a single "row" within which are two elements which both span 12 columns (col-12).  In bootstrap terms that means they will both take up the full width of the container and hence will appear below each other. 
If they had both been set to col-6 they would appear beside each other each taking half the width.  If they had been specified as col-8 and col-4 they would be beside each other with the first taking up 2/3 and the second 1/3 of the width.
